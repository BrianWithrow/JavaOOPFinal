Product Creator

My name is Brian and this project was a part of my Junior year in FGCU's Software Engineering major.
An OOP project that demonstrates a lot of different understandings towards OOP concepts!
This currently includes:
Products, Media Players, Audio Players, Screens, Employees for our company, and different functionality between all of them.

Built with Intellij, big thanks to Professor Vanselow and ORACLE.
