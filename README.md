# Product Creator

### About me
My name is Brian Withrow and this project was a part of my Junior year in FGCU's Software Engineering major.

### This Project
An OOP project that demonstrates a lot of different understandings towards OOP concepts!
This currently includes:
Products, Media Players, Audio Players, Screens, Employees for our company, and different functionality between all of them.

## Skip the nitty gritty, give me the goods.
I get it, want to see a class diagram for a quick understanding?
Here you go.
